## DeepSeek R1 

I wonder if I can pair some of them or use operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, exponents, or even concatenation. The problem says "arbitrary mathematical operators," so
maybe concatenation is allowed? For example, combining 7 and 4 to make 74. But the original numbers are
all three digits, so perhaps I need to use them as they are. Wait, the problem says "with these and
only these numbers," so I can't split them into digits. Got it.

Let me try to see if adding some of them gets close to 720. Let's add 435 and 378: 435 + 378 = 813.
That's over 720. How about 774 - 435? That's 339. Not close. Maybe 822 - 187? 822 - 187 = 635. Still
not 720. Hmm. 774 - 623? 774 - 623 = 151. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe multiplication. Let's see: 435 * 2 = 870. That's way over. 187 * 4 = 748. Close, but not
720. What if I do 774 - 54? But where do I get 54? Maybe from 435 - 378 = 57. Not 54. Alternatively,
623 - 187 = 436. Then 822 - 436 = 386. Not sure.

Perhaps division. Let's see: 774 divided by 1.075 gives 720. But how to get 1.075 from the other
numbers? Not sure. Alternatively, 435 + 435 = 870, which is 150 more than 720. Maybe subtract 150. But
where to get 150? 187 - 37 = 150, but not sure how to get that.

Alternatively, maybe use exponents. For example, 6^3 = 216. But I don't have a 6, unless I extract
digits, which I probably can't. Wait, the number 623 has a 6. But the problem states to use the numbers
as whole, so splitting digits isn't allowed. So exponents might not be helpful here.

Another approach: let's sum all the numbers and see what we get. 187 + 623 = 810. 810 + 435 = 1245. 1245
+ 822 = 2067. 2067 + 774 = 2841. 2841 + 378 = 3219. Total sum is 3219. If I need to reach 720, maybe
subtract some combination. But this seems too vague.

Maybe group numbers into pairs. For instance, 822 - 623 = 199. Then 774 - 435 = 339. Then 378 - 187 =
191. Not sure how these help.

Wait, 774 - 54 = 720. Where can I get 54? Let's see: 435 divided by 8.055... Not helpful. Alternatively,
378 divided by 7 = 54. But 7 isn't one of the numbers. Hmm.

Alternatively, 435 + 378 = 813. Then 813 - 93 = 720. How to get 93? 187 - 94 = 93. But 94 from where?
Not obvious.

Let me think of factors of 720. 720 = 8 * 90 = 12 * 60 = 15 * 48 = 20 * 36 = 24 * 30. Maybe find pairs
that can make these factors. For example, 24 * 30. 24 can be 774 / 32.25, which is messy.
Alternatively, 20 * 36. 20 could be 435 - 415, but 415 isn't in the numbers.

Alternatively, 720 = 900 - 180. How to get 900 and 180? 822 + 78 = 900. 78 can be 187 - 109. Not
helpful.

Wait, maybe 774 - (623 - 187) = 774 - 436 = 338. Not helpful.

Let me try combining multiple numbers. For example, 822 - 187 - 435 = 200. Then 200 * 3.6 = 720. But how
to get 3.6 from the remaining numbers: 623, 774, 378. Let's see. Maybe 774 / 623 ≈ 1.242. Then 378 -
1.242 ≈ 376.758. Then divide by 104.666 (623/6 ≈ 104.666). That gives 376.758 / 104.666 ≈ 3.6. So 200 *
3.6 = 720. But this seems convoluted and uses division and subtraction in a complicated way.

Alternatively, maybe 774 + 378 = 1152. Then subtract 435: 1152 - 435 = 717. Then add 3: 717 + 3 = 720.
But how to get 3 from the remaining numbers: 187, 623, 822. Maybe 623 - 187 = 436. Then 822 - 436 =
386. Then 386 / 128.666 ≈ 3. Again, not straightforward.

Is there a simpler way? Maybe using division. For example, 720 = (822 - 187 - 435) * (774 / (623 -
378)). Let's check: 822-187=635, 635-435=200. 623-378=245. 774/245≈3.159. 200*3.159≈631.8. Not 720.

Alternatively, (774 - (435 - 378)) * (822 / 623 + 187). Not sure.

Wait, maybe 720 = 378 + 342. 342 can be 435 - 93. How to get 93? 187 - 94, but again stuck.

Another angle: 720 is 6! (6 factorial) which is 720. But the numbers don't include 6, but maybe using
factorials? The problem allows arbitrary operators, so factorial is allowed. Let me check. If I take 6!
from the digits, but since we can't split numbers, maybe use 435 as 4+3+5=12, but no, we have to use
the numbers as whole. So factorials might not help here.

Alternatively, 720 = 8 * 90. Can I get 8 and 90 from the numbers? 822 divided by 102.75 = 8. Not
helpful. 90 could be 435 - 345. Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe subtraction: 822 - 102 = 720. How to get 102? 187 - 85. Not helpful. Alternatively, 623 - 521
= 102. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe 774 - 54 = 720. To get 54, 378 divided by 7 = 54. But 7 is not available. Alternatively, 435
- 381 = 54. 381 is 187 + 194. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 623 - 569 = 54. 569 is 435 + 134. Not helpful.

This is tricky. Let me think of combining three numbers. 187 + 623 + 435 = 1245. Then 1245 - 525 = 720.
525 could be 822 - 297. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 774 + 378 = 1152. 115
